<p>I am an undergraduate at the University of Florida studying Mathematics, with a strong interest in (bio)statistics.</p>
<p>I spent this past summer working at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center under Tim Randolph. There, I analyzed a variety of high-dimensional omics data, and developed an <a href="https://www.github.com/pknight24/KPR">R package</a> for fitting Kernel Penalized Regression models.</p>
<p>I also work with Rhonda Bacherâ€™s group at the UF Department of
  Biostatistics. I am currently studying algorithms for the efficient
  visualization of methylation data.</p>
