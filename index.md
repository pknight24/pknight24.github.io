### Parker Knight

I am an undergraduate at the University of Florida studying
Mathematics, with a strong interest in (bio)statistics.

I spent this past summer working at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center under Tim Randolph. There, I analyzed a variety of
high-dimensional omics data, and developed an [R
package](https://www.github.com/pknight24/KPR) for fitting Kernel
Penalized Regression models.

I also work with Rhonda Bacher's group at the UF Department of
Biostatistics. I am currently studying algorithms for the efficient
visualization of methylation data.
