### Parker Knight 

I am a doctoral student in biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health, supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. My advisor is [Rui
Duan](https://sites.google.com/view/ruiduan).

My research develops theory and methods to address challenges arising from
large scale, multi-institutional biomedical science. Recently, I am focused on:

1. Designing interpretable models and integrative methods for data sampled from heterogenous
sources.

2. Developing methods that capture temporal patterns in massive electronic health records datasets and
leveraging these patterns in downstream risk prediction tasks.

3. Understanding fundamental limits of signal detection in high-dimensional,
matrix-structured data.

My methodological work relies on tools from nonparametric statistics,
high-dimensional probability, and optimization. I have also benefited greatly from
ongoing collaborations with the [PsycheMERGE
consortium.](https://psychemerge.com)
 
Before coming to Harvard, I was a mathematics major at the University of
Florida, where I explored interests in neuroscience, bioinformatics, and
functional programming. I spent a summer working with [Tim Randolph](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/randolph-tim.html) at the Fred Hutch
in Seattle, WA, and served on the executive board of UF's Center for Undergraduate
Research.
