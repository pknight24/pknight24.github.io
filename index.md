### Parker Knight 

I am a doctoral student in biostatistics at Harvard
University, supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. My advisor is [Rui
Duan](https://sites.google.com/view/ruiduan).

My research develops theory and methods for data integration problems in high
dimensions. I'm motivated by challenges posed by electronic
health records and genotype data.

 
Before coming to Harvard, I was a mathematics major at the University of
Florida, where I explored interests in neuroscience, bioinformatics, and
functional programming. I spent a summer working with [Tim Randolph](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/randolph-tim.html) at the Fred Hutch
in Seattle, WA, and served on the executive board of UF's Center for Undergraduate
Research.
