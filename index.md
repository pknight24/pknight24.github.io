### Parker Knight 

I am a doctoral student in biostatistics at Harvard
University, supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

My research focuses on designing statistical machine learning tools that address real-world constraints, especially data sharing restrictions and covariate shift. I am advised by Rui Duan, and also work closely with Tianxi Cai.

 
Before coming to Harvard, I was a mathematics major at the University of
Florida, where I explored interests in neuroscience, bioinformatics, and
functional programming. I spent a summer working with [Tim Randolph](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/randolph-tim.html) at the Fred Hutch
in Seattle, WA, and served on the executive board of UF's Center for Undergraduate
Research.
