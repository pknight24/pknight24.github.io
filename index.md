### Parker Knight 

I am a doctoral student in biostatistics at Harvard
University, supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

My research focuses on high-dimensional estimation, prediction, and signal detection problems
in statistical genetics. Recently, I'm thinking about:

- How can we leverage genetic correlations between traits to improve polygenic
  risk prediction? With what confidence can we make these predictions when we
  only have access to GWAS summary statistics?
- What are the fundamental limits of testing for multi-phenotype-multi-genotype
  assocations under structured alternatives? Can we efficiently scale these tests to large,
  high-dimensional datasets?


I work closely on these problems with [Rui
Duan](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/rui-duan/) and [Rajarshi
Mukherjee](https://scholar.harvard.edu/rajarshi/home).
  
Before coming to Harvard, I was a mathematics major at the University of
Florida, where I explored interests in neuroscience, bioinformatics, and
functional programming. I spent a summer working with [Tim Randolph](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/randolph-tim.html) at the Fred Hutch
in Seattle, WA, and served on the executive board of UF's Center for Undergraduate
Research.
