### Parker Knight 

I am a doctoral student in biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health, supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. My advisor is [Rui
Duan](https://sites.google.com/view/ruiduan).

My research develops theory and methods for data integration problems in high
dimensions. I'm motivated by challenges posed by electronic
health records and genotype data, especially pertaining to model
shifts across environments and embeddings for heterogeneous temporal data. I'm also interested in
minimax testing problems and the philosophy of science.
 
Before coming to Harvard, I was a mathematics major at the University of
Florida, where I explored interests in neuroscience, bioinformatics, and
functional programming. I spent a summer working with [Tim Randolph](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/randolph-tim.html) at the Fred Hutch
in Seattle, WA, and served on the executive board of UF's Center for Undergraduate
Research.
