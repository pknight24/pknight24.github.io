<p>I am a doctoral student in biostatistics at Harvard University, supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. My advisor is <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ruiduan">Rui Duan</a>.</p>
<p>My research develops theory and methods for data integration problems in high dimensions. I’m motivated by challenges posed by electronic health records and genotype data.</p>
<p>Before coming to Harvard, I was a mathematics major at the University of Florida, where I explored interests in neuroscience, bioinformatics, and functional programming. I spent a summer working with <a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/randolph-tim.html">Tim Randolph</a> at the Fred Hutch in Seattle, WA, and served on the executive board of UF’s Center for Undergraduate Research.</p>
