<p>I am a doctoral student in biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health, supported by an NSF Graduate Research
Fellowship. My advisor is <a
href="https://sites.google.com/view/ruiduan">Rui Duan</a>.</p>
<p>My research develops theory and methods for data integration problems
in high dimensions. I’m motivated by challenges posed by electronic
health records and genotype data, especially pertaining to model shifts
across environments and embeddings for heterogeneous temporal data. I’m
also interested in minimax testing problems and the philosophy of
science.</p>
<p>Before coming to Harvard, I was a mathematics major at the University
of Florida, where I explored interests in neuroscience, bioinformatics,
and functional programming. I spent a summer working with <a
href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/randolph-tim.html">Tim
Randolph</a> at the Fred Hutch in Seattle, WA, and served on the
executive board of UF’s Center for Undergraduate Research.</p>
