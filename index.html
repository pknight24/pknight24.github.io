<p>I am an undergraduate at the University of Florida studying Mathematics, with a strong interest in (bio)statistics.</p>
<p>I spent last summer working at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
  Research Center under Tim Randolph. There, I analyzed a variety of
  high-dimensional omics data, and developed
  an <a href="https://www.gitlab.com/plbknight/KPR">R package</a> for
  fitting Kernel Penalized Regression models. I'm currently working
  on expanding this method to incorporate adaptive kernel penalties,
  advised by Sara Pollock with UF's Department of Mathematics. This
  will be the topic of my undergraduate thesis. </p> 
<p>I also work with Rhonda Bacherâ€™s group at the UF Department of
  Biostatistics. I am currently studying algorithms for the efficient
  visualization of methylation data, as well as single-cell trajectory
  inference methods.</p>
